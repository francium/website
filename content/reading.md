### Andy Wier, *The Martian*

2018-02-14

One of the reasons I really enjoyed this book was the period in which it took place --
modern times. Not some far of hypothetical future with faster-than-light travel or in
some futuristic distopian Earth. The story doesn't try to imagine anything beyond what
modern science and technology are capable of producing -- well that part is generously
sped up a few decades or so -- and the situations in which the POV character finds
himself are situations you would expect an astronaut to be in. After all, when you think
of an astronaut you think of a person in a bulky white suit doing crazy science
experiments in zero gravity. Well that's exactly the type of story Wier has created.

Humans land on mars, do some science, the *Martian dust* hits the fan, and decide to go
back home while they still physically able too. Minus one astronaut who dies on his way
to the spaceship.

Well it turns out that one astronaut didn't die. So he decides to camp out on Mars for a
while -- at least until his food runs out. And he does some crazy science, primarily
involving biology...

It's a story of science and adventure. It's told very well and with minimal advances in
science and technology. If you're looking for a Sci-Fi story without crazy, alternative,
hypothetical future science things, then it's a fantastic read.


### Scalzi, *Old Man's War*

2018-02-14

Scalzi's universe is in a state of total war. The Colonial Union and Colonial Deference
Forces represent humanity in Universe and are looking to expand while in competition with
all other alien race who themselves are doing the same -- except the Consu; the Consu are
badass. But the story itself focuses on the adventures of an individual, senior, recruit
who's tour of duty takes him to distance star systems to kill anything that isn't human.

Through a series of interesting events, Perry, our lead character, find himself in a
number of very interesting situations and meets many interesting some -- some from a past
life as it happens.

The story itself was enjoyable and the twists added some suspense. It's not the most epic
of stories and some parts seem to go by rather quickly without any prolonged build up.
Regardless, a good read and gives the reader somethings to think about: our place in this
big universe, what it is to be human, and the nature of humanity.


### Vonnegut, *Slaughterhouse-Five*

2018-02-15

I throughly enjoyed reading Slaughterhouse-Five. It is a wonderful mishmash the ordinary
and extraordinary elements of comedy, adventure and Sci-Fi rolled into a series of
time-warping events over the course of the characters life time.

Vonnegut brought comedy into the grim realities of war, all the while not taking anything
away from what war is. The inclusion of the Tralfamadorians bring another dimension --
literally -- to the story.

The story is told in one of the most unique ways I've ever seen. It's flashbacks taken to
a whole new level. You could be in a dark bedroom one moments and suddenly be walking
around in a European city circa WWII. But the flashbacks really help develop the story
and character. Some of the flashbacks help the reader better make sense of how the events
of the past can impact the distant future. The constant flipping between time frames also
mirrors the way the Tralfamadorians view time (for whom time is just another spacial
dimension). In a sense, the book seems to be told more from a Tralfamadorians point of
view than that of a human.


### Foer, *Moon Walking with Einstein*

2018-02-14

Foer describes his 1 year journey as a journalist training in ancient techniques of
mnemonics. The unique prospective allows the reader to experience the steps one must go
through to go from novice to experiences in a brand new field.

The techniques listed are a introduction to a practice that was once held in high regard
in the world of antiquity. Although the book is far from a detailed guide, it does
present many techniques that can be applied with just a little practice to improve one's
own memory in everyday life. Josh's own experiences, as accounted in the story, also give
a summary of how he applied the new techniques and the way in which he was able to keep
improving his skills over the course of the year.

Currently midway through, but very engaging and insight book so far.


### Lovecraft, *Pickman's Model*

2019-06-03

Lovecraft has a rather unique writing style. If I recall, The Call of Cthulhu also
employed story-within-story elements to tell the story. A very similar approach is taken
by Lovecraft in Pickman's Model. The story itself is quite interesting and pulls you in.
Best part of this short story is the memorable ending. Although it's not hard to unravel
the mystery yourself, the ending is still quite enjoyable.


### Lovecraft, *The Color Out Of Space*

2019-06-03

This story is a bit stranger than Pickman's Model. And unlike Pickman's model, Lovecraft
take some time to paint a more detailed picture of some of the characters and settings.
The story itself also take some time to naturally pan out, but delivers a good conclusion.
It's not a happily ever after story, but I don't think Lovecraft is know for those. It's
also quite interesting to see how much stories like this have been able to influence
modern movies. You get a sense that there are many elements utilized by Lovecraft that are
common or at least similar to the ones used in modern sci-fi movies.


### Harari, *Sapiens: A Breif History of Humankind*

2019-06-25

Sapiens is a crash course in human history. The book covers the history of humans from
prehistory to present day. Along the way many concepts, such as Biology, religion, science
and technology, are considered and the reader get a glimpse at how and why civilization
turned out the way it did. The book does not spend a lot of time on one particular period
of time, it's very much a crash course. It's enough to provide a high level overview of
our path here, but provides enough material to be a very enlightening read.

### Stephenson, *Snow Crash*

2019-08-11

Snow Crash is like a movie in words. I pictured many events in the story as
scenes taken out of a Hollywood movie -- car chases, explosions, gun fights,
sword fights, and many other typical action movie scenes. Overall Snow Crash was
a unique and thrilling experience -- besides some rather dull bits where people
just stand around talking about ancient history and stuff. Given the book was
written in the early 90s, it's really remarkable how well it holds up now and
how accurately some details have come to be in reality. Definitely a book worth
reading -- many enjoyable characters, Hiro and YT are really well developed
characters with enjoyable dialog and story lings, and a thrilling overall story
that keep you reading.

As a side note, a general observation about Stephenson's writings, having read
Snow Crash and The Diamond Age as of writing this, there is a lot of world
building that's founded on some good and well thought-out idea about society and
technology. Both books paint a very vivid picture of an alternative timeline of
the world since the 20th century. Stephenson also make used to technical jargon
that sometimes feels obtuse, such as emphasizing binary digits and power of two,
but other times helps the story feel deeper and well grounded in logic and
believable ideas.

### Stephenson, *The Diamond Age, or A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer*

2019-08-11

After reading Snow Crash, I had high expectations. I was a bit disappointed, but
maybe that was due to the radically different setting and style of the book.
It's a standalone story and with not much, if any, connection to Snow Crash. I
would've be interested in seeing connections to Snow Crash though. The story has
different parallel character arcs that converge in the end. The story itself was
fine, although I think it had some underlying connections I didn't fully try to
understand which maybe the reason I didn't really feel satisfied at the end.
That being said, the character development was good and decent enough to pull it
all together. Overall though, not in my favorites.

### Cox, *Why Does E=MC2?*

2019-09-13

Brian Cox wonderfully explained groundbreaking physics concepts in an easy to
understand manner. The book overall is a fantastic journey through space and
time (quite literally), from the brilliance of Einstein and many other
physicists to cosmos and beyond. This book is filled with brilliant and
insightful knowledge; worth not just a read, but also a re-read.

### Hawking, *The Universe in a Nutshell*

2019-09-13

This book, like Brian Cox', *Why Does E=MC2?*, is a brilliant and down to earth
explanation of astronomical concepts. Enjoyable and educational, it's packed
with amazing concepts and ideas that will be just as enjoyable on subsequent
reads.
