- Wayland has blurry text, can't mix DPIs
- With XOrg you do get tearing but can mix DPIs with xrandr
- Everything works out of the box, except finger print reader, did not test webcam
  (thermal)
- 1.5 scale works really nicely for 2k monitor
- Keyboard is amazing after using original non-retina macbook pro keyboards
    - Very solid, satisfying typing experience, one of the best non-mechanical keyboards
- Battery life after disabling unused IO devices, changing Thunderbolt settings in BIOS to
  reduce wakeups and with TLP installed
    - SD reader, webcam(s), mics, bluetooth disabled
    - Power consumption ranges from
        - ~2.9W with lowest brightness and totally idle, but normally above 3W (15+  hours)
        - avg 4-5 idle reading with moderate brightness (10+ hours)
        - 5-10 during regular use (7-8+ hours)
- Fan is silent during regular usage, even with video playback temperate is normally less
  than 45C with stock Linux fan control
- Speakers are not super loud, but serviceable
- Touchpad is a downgrade from a mac, but probably better than the average touchpad on
  non-mac hardware
  - Has a grainy/rubbery/siliconish/rough texture, take a bit of getting used to compared
    to a mac's touchpad which is very smooth
- Touchpoint is nice and with practice could be very usable
- Fn/Ctrl can be swapped in BIOS, Function Key mode can be swapped in hardware too, as
  well as on the fly with fn-lock
- No media keys
- PrintScn key is in a stupid location
- Page up/down keys are annoying and in a stupid location, easy to press them instead of
  arrow keys
- can connect 2 external monitors
- Sleep battery consumption is pretty significant, ~1%/hr lost while sleeping
- 2k screen is very good, matte, can get quite bright (the FHD is less bright) and very
  usable in most working conditions
