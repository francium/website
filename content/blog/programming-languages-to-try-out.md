## Functional

### [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
I've used Elm over the last few months on a couple of small projects. Haskell
make be an interesting complement to what I've learned in Elm. It may be worth
while to see the differences between Elm and Haskell, as Elm is the first
functional language I've ever used.

### Lisp ([Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/) maybe?)
One of the oldest languages and one of the most expressive as I've heard.  Paul
Graham of *Y Combinator* wrote a very interesting article, [*Beating the
Averages*][graham-1], about the power of lisp over other languages . It was one of the
sources of my interest in lisp.

### [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
A languages in the long line of lisp-y languages. Also heard some interesting
things about it. Eli Berndersky's [*Clojure - the perfect language to expand your
brain?*][brendersky-1] is one that's on my reading list before jumping into
Clojure.

### [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
I've heard my good things about Elixir. At one point I even went though a few
pages of the tutorial/docs on the Elixir site. I've typically done my
server-side programming in Python, but Elixir may be very very nice to work
with if I want to try out a side project with a fully functional stack.

### [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/)
A compile to JavaScript language. Based on haskell. Knowing Elm may be helpful
in learning this.

### [Red](http://www.red-lang.org/)
The ultimate language? The [about page](http://www.red-lang.org/p/about.html) seems to
suggest so.

## OOP

### [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)
I've not read up or heard too much about Crystal. It's a statically typed,
compiled Ruby like language. I have not used Ruby in any significant amount so
it may be an interesting experience.

### [Pony](https://ponylang.org)
A actor-model high performance language. Don't know a lot about it, but might
be interesting since it is based on the actor model.

### [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)
A modern typed memory-safe language. While I've used C and C++ (albeit poorly)
in the past, I would really like to see what Rust offers and how much more
power it gives the programmer over unsafe languages like C and C++ all the
while retaining the power of the language itself.
