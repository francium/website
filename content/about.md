title: About
---

Usually trying to learn, sometimes writing code. Worked on various things over the years,
but still have a long way to go.

A brief summary,

- Speak JavaScript, Python, Elm, Java, C, C++, and a few more (in order of experience)
- Know my way around a [Lin]u[ni]x CLI and common development tools
- Professional experience working on a web SPA frontend (Angular) and backend server
- Other buzzwords: SQL, Flask, Django, Node, REST, Docker, Containers, Cloud, React
- This was typed in Vim

If you’ve made it this far, perhaps you’d be interested in looking at some of [my projects](/projects).

Hire me for a cool project? <francium@francium.cc>
