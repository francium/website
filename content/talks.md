#### [Hammock Driven Development - Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)
- It is import to step away and think throughly and deeply about what the problem
  trying to be solved is and how to best solve it
- By thinking deeply you allow yourself to propose new solutions to the problem and
  see difference ways to solve it
- Take advantage of subconscious thought processes and the brain's ability to
  generate ideas during rest and sleep

#### [Rails Conf 2012 Keynote: Simplicity Matters by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0)
> Simplicity is not about you and simplicity is hard work. It is actually work to do
> the job of simplifying things, but there's a huge payoff; The person who has
> a genuinely simpler system, a system made out of genuinely simple parts is
> going to be able to affect greater change with the least work. He's going to kick
> your ass, right, he's never going to 'gem install a hairball'. He's going to
> spend more time simplifying things up front and in the long haul he's going to
> wipe the plate with your because he - or she - because they'll have the ability to
> change things when you're struggling to push elephants around

#### [Entwicklertag 2016: How Agile and OO have lost their way together - James Coplien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOyNfmqwR98)
- An overview of Scrum, Agile, OO (class based and actual object based), software
  development practices, where things have been misconstrued, mis interpreted and
  ideally how things were originally intended to be utilitized
- Software development relies too much on tools and not enough on the interaction of
  customers, developers and software systems

#### [Why TDD Is Crap - Eric Smith, 8th Light - WindyCityRails 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQBf6li1hww)
- TDD is overused and excessively applied to trying to test single units of software
- Results in many tests that are not essential and creates additional code that will
  need to be managed and require additional resources
- Alternative ways of testing are proposed and the emphasis is not relying only on
  unit test to assert correct software

## Web

#### [The Birth & Death of JavaScript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript)


## Functional Programming

#### [Functional architecture - The pits of success - Mark Seemann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US8QG9I1XW0)
- Overview and examples of how functional programming principles can be applied to
  create elegant solutions to problems in application development
- Key points are:
    - Ports and adapters
    - Services, entities, value objects
    - Testability
- Gives insight into how the Onion/Hexagonal architecture can be created in a natural
  way in functional programming and the end result is a system that is stable in
  terms of refactoring and maintainability because pure functions are composed in a
  way that anything unpure has to be relegated to the edges for everything to work --
  leading to better maintainability

#### [From Dependency injection to dependency rejection - Mark Seemann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxs7oLGrxQ4)
- Somewhat of a continuation of Seemann's 'Function architecture - The pits of
  success' talk
- Focus is a bit more on how DI is used in OOP languages and how best to approach FP
  when coming from that mindset

#### [Functional Programming Patterns for Mere Mortals - Daniel Chambers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9QGWbGppis)
- Overview of a few major design patterns common in functional programming: functors,
  applicatives, and monads
- Lots of examples in F# and Haskell, as well as comparable implementation in OOP
  languages (C#)
- Good introduction to applying functional programming to design larger blocks of
  code that fit well together and simplify many common procedures in a sane manner
